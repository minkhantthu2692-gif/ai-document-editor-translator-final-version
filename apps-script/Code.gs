/**
 * ============================================================================
 * AI Documents Translator & Editor — Cloud Sync Backend (Google Apps Script)
 * ============================================================================
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS
 *   A stateless JSON Web App backend that the local-first web app (src/sync/)
 *   calls to mirror its IndexedDB data into a Google Sheet. All data lives in
 *   the spreadsheet; the script never keeps state between requests beyond the
 *   sheets themselves.
 *
 * SHEETS (auto-created with fixed header rows)
 *   Projects, Pages, Blocks, Glossary, Settings, UsageStats, ApiKeys, SyncLog.
 *   Canonical header layout for every syncable sheet:
 *     ['id', 'updatedAt', 'deviceId', 'version', 'deleted', ...entity fields]
 *   Two kinds of entity field live after those five columns:
 *     - SCALAR COLUMNS — the fields a human (or a Sheets filter) wants to see
 *       and the backend has to sort/filter on: name, projectId, pageId, order,
 *       kind, status, sourceText, translatedText, sourceTerm, targetTerm,
 *       provider, model, day, … . Each gets its own 50k cell, so a long
 *       paragraph and its translation never compete with the rest of the row
 *       for the same budget.
 *     - the trailing `data` column — nested/complex fields only (block
 *       geometry, visual lines, run styling, table cells, link boxes, …),
 *       JSON-encoded. That keeps the read/write code generic without pushing
 *       a document's content into an opaque blob.
 *   The client writes the *whole* record every time, so a field simply moving
 *   from `data` into a column (a later build declaring it) needs no back-fill:
 *   `rowToRecord_` prefers a non-empty column and falls back to the JSON for
 *   rows written before the column existed.
 *
 * SCHEMA EVOLUTION (why the migration exists)
 *   Columns are only ever renamed in place or APPENDED — never inserted, never
 *   moved — because `data` must stay in the column index it was written at:
 *   moving it would need a full-sheet rewrite, and a crash half-way through
 *   that would leave every nested field stranded in the wrong column. Appends
 *   are a single header-row write: crash before it and the old layout is still
 *   intact, crash after it and the new one is already correct.
 *   `createMissingSheets_` recognises a layout listed in LEGACY_HEADERS_ and
 *   rewrites row 1 to today's headers; rows written under the old layout keep
 *   reading correctly through the `data` fallback above.
 *
 *   Deletions are TOMBSTONES: `op:'delete'` sets the `deleted` column to TRUE
 *   and bumps updatedAt/version; rows are never physically removed (except by
 *   the explicit `wipe` action). This is what makes deletions propagate to
 *   other devices through `pullChanges`.
 *
 * HOW TO DEPLOY
 *   1. Create (or open) a Google Sheet.
 *   2. Extensions → Apps Script. Delete any placeholder code, paste this file
 *      into `Code.gs`, and paste `appsscript.json` over the manifest
 *      (View → Show manifest file).
 *   3. Project Settings → Script Properties → add `TOKEN` = a long random
 *      string (e.g. 32+ chars from a password generator). This is the shared
 *      secret the web app sends in every request. Optional: `SPREADSHEET_ID`
 *      if you deploy the script standalone instead of bound to the Sheet.
 *   4. Deploy → New deployment → Type: Web app → Execute as: **Me** →
 *      Who has access: **Anyone** → Authorize (the spreadsheet scope only).
 *   5. Copy the displayed `/exec` URL into the web app's sync settings.
 *   6. To rotate the token: change the Script Property value only. Nothing in
 *      this file (or in the Sheet) ever contains it.
 *
 * SECURITY NOTES
 *   - Every request must carry `token`; it is compared against the `TOKEN`
 *     Script Property with a length check + XOR loop (constant-time-ish), so
 *     response timing does not leak the secret character by character.
 *   - The token is NEVER echoed back, never logged to SyncLog, never written
 *     to any sheet, and never included in an error message.
 *   - Provider API keys are stored in the `ApiKeys` sheet ONLY when the user
 *     turns on "API keys" in Settings → Cloud sync — it is off by default,
 *     the client says what will happen before it is switched on, and the
 *     values are written in the clear. The spreadsheet is the user's own
 *     database (they created it, they hold the TOKEN, they control sharing)
 *     and re-typing every key on every device is what the option removes.
 *     Turning it off stops new writes; it does not erase rows already
 *     written — delete the sheet or run `wipe` for that.
 *   - The `Settings` sheet still refuses any record whose key name matches
 *     /key|token|secret|password|authorization/i and fails the whole request
 *     with `SECRET_NOT_ALLOWED`, so the shared TOKEN cannot reach the
 *     spreadsheet from that path. The token itself is never in this file.
 *   - Apps Script web apps always answer HTTP 200, so failures are reported
 *     inside the JSON envelope as `{ ok:false, code, message }`.
 *   - All error paths return generic messages: no stack traces, no request
 *     bodies, no tokens.
 *
 * CORS / CLIENT REQUIREMENTS
 *   - The browser client MUST POST with `Content-Type: text/plain` (plain
 *     text body containing JSON). A `application/json` body would trigger a
 *     CORS preflight OPTIONS request, which Apps Script web apps do not
 *     handle, and the POST would fail in the browser.
 *   - Apps Script responds with `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` only for
 *     deployments set to "Execute as: Me / Anyone". The script itself cannot
 *     set response headers (no such API), so nothing to configure here.
 *   - `doGet` (health) and `doPost` (all actions) both return
 *     `ContentService` JSON output. `doGet` takes the token as a `token`
 *     query parameter and refuses everything else: an unauthenticated health
 *     probe used to reveal the spreadsheet's tab inventory (and create tabs)
 *     for anyone who guessed the URL. The web app never calls it — the app's
 *     "Test connection" is an authenticated `ping` POST.
 *
 * EXECUTION LIMITS
 *   - Apps Script stops a web app run after 6 minutes. A shared budget
 *     (`EXEC_BUDGET_MS_` = 300s − 15s = 285s) is checked
 *     inside long loops; when it runs out the handler returns
 *     `{ ok:true, partial:true, nextCursor }` and the client simply calls the
 *     same action again with that cursor. Because every write is
 *     last-write-wins and idempotent, resuming is always safe.
 *   - All reads use one `getRange(...).getValues()` per sheet and all writes
 *     go through `writePlain_(...)`, which formats the destination as Plain
 *     Text and then calls `setValues(...)` in chunks of `CHUNK_ROWS_` (100)
 *     rows. There are no per-cell get/set loops anywhere.
 *   - Plain Text is not cosmetic: Sheets parses a cell on the way in, so a
 *     string starting with `=` would be written as a live formula. A document
 *     that opens with `=IMPORTDATA(...)` would then phone home from the
 *     user's own Sheet. Formatting the range first makes that impossible
 *     without altering the value, so a hyphen bullet survives the round trip.
 *   - Google Sheets caps a cell at 50,000 characters, so any string longer
 *     than `MAX_CELL_CHARS_` (45,000) is truncated before the write and the
 *     truncation is recorded in SyncLog instead of failing the request.
