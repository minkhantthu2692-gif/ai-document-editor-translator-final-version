 * DOCX export builder (Phase 4).
 *
 * Turns an `ExportDocument` into Office Open XML bytes with the `docx`
 * library. The packing path is browser-safe: the installed docx v9 build has
 * no `Packer.toUint8Array`, so bytes are produced with `Packer.toArrayBuffer`
 * and `Packer.toBlob` + `blob.arrayBuffer()` is the fallback — neither touches
 * Node's `Buffer`, so the export worker can hand the `Uint8Array` back as-is.
 *
 * Every run declares the export font (readers without it fall back to their
 * own default), RTL text gets `w:bidi` on the paragraph and `w:rtl` on the run
 * so Arabic/Hebrew shape correctly, and page geometry flows from the first
 * source page (PDF points → twips, 1pt = 20twips).
 *
 * Pure data in, bytes out: no DOM access, so this runs in a worker and under
 * Vitest (jsdom) unchanged.
