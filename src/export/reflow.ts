/**
 * Vertical reflow for an absolutely-positioned page (phase (d) — export height
 * handling, and the editor canvas that has to agree with it).
 *
 * Auto-fit (`src/editor/autofit.ts`) is shrink-only and stops at a readable
 * 6pt, so a page can still hold a block whose Burmese is taller than the box
 * cut for its English. Absolutely positioning every block at the `y` the PDF
 * gave it meant the text simply painted over whatever came below.
 *
 * This pass makes room instead. It is a *push-down*, not a re-layout: a block
 * that still fits keeps its extracted position and height to the point, so a
 * document whose text all grew no more than its boxes can hold comes back
 * byte-identical, and only the surplus is spent.
 *
 * Two rules keep the push honest about the page it is working on:
 *
 *  - **Only the block above you can move you.** Two blocks that shared a row
 *    in the source — a second column, or a full-width band with the columns it
 *    sits on — are never treated as cause and effect, so growth in column one
 *    leaves column two alone. "Above" is judged on the *extracted* boxes, not
 *    the grown ones, so a band that grew still pushes both columns under it.
 *  - **The page cannot grow.** The page box is fixed, so a push stops at the
 *    bottom edge rather than printing half a block onto the next sheet. A
 *    block too tall to fit anywhere is left exactly where it was.
 *
 * The function is generic over the geometry it needs, so the editor's
 * `BlockRecord` and the export's `ExportBlock` go through the same pass and
 * cannot drift. Every caller decides what a block will actually print; pass
 * that text through `textOf` and the measurement cannot drift from the render.
