/**
 * Table detection acceptance tests.
 *
 * Two things are being pinned here, and they pull in opposite directions:
 *
 *  - the block builder must turn a real table — cells as separate positioned
 *    show-text operators — into one rectangular grid, which only geometry can
 *    do because `groupItemsIntoLines` has already flattened the layout out of
 *    `line.text`;
 *  - the reading-order pass must keep cutting a row fused across a column
 *    gutter, which only the text form can tell apart from a table row, since
 *    the two fixtures in `readingOrder.test.ts` differ in no measurable way
 *    except that one was written with a double space.
 *
 * `fixtures/table.pdf` is the end of this: it is built cell by cell, exactly
 * as a document processor writes a table, and neither of its pages can be
 * reached by any test that constructs a line by hand.
