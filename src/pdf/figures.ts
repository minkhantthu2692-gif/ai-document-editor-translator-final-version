/**
 * Anchoring figures to the text they illustrate.
 *
 * Extraction finds *where* a picture is (`imageOps.ts`); this module decides
 * whether it is a figure at all, and which paragraph it belongs to. Without
 * that pairing a translated document keeps the words and loses the picture:
 * the caption says "Figure 3" and there is nothing above it, because a picture
 * has no text to hang off and therefore never became a block.
 *
 * Two filters do the heavy lifting, and both are about telling a figure apart
 * from page furniture:
 *
 *   - **size** — a wash, a scan or a full-bleed background is bigger than the
 *     page, a rule or a bar is thinner than a caption, a dot or an icon is
 *     smaller than the smallest thing anyone labels. Tiled patterns are caught
 *     by the cap on how many figures one block may carry.
 *   - **coverage** — type sitting *on* the image means the image is behind the
 *     page's text rather than next to it. A chart's own axis labels cover a
 *     sliver of it and pass; a background texture under a paragraph does not.
 *
 * Anchoring is staged rather than scored: a labelled caption wins, then the
 * nearest body block on either side within half a page. That order is what
 * makes a `Figure 3.` line the figure's caption even when another paragraph
 * sits closer to it, and it keeps the failure mode gentle — a figure with no
 * text near it is dropped, and the HTML/PDF exports still show it as page art.
 *
 * Pure: numbers and blocks in, blocks mutated. `pdfExtract.test.ts` exercises
 * it end to end against a generated fixture.
