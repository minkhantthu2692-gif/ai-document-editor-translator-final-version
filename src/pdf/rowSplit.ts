/**
 * Table-row detection.
 *
 * Split out of `structure.ts` because it is needed by *two* consumers with
 * opposite instincts: the block builder wants to know whether a run of lines is
 * a table, and the reading-order pass wants to know which lines it must leave
 * alone. Both live in modules that would otherwise have to import each other.
 *
 * ### Two questions, two answers — and the page break between them
 *
 * **"Is this run of lines a table?"** (`tableForLines`) is asked once a block
 * exists and answered off geometry: pdf.js emits one text item per show-text
 * operator, so every cell of a row arrives as its own run with its own x, and
 * the gap between two cells is layout rather than typography. The block only
 * qualifies when the cut positions *recur across rows* — a table is aligned
 * columns, and one long word space in one line is not a column.
 *
 * **"Must reading order leave this line whole?"** (`looksLikeTableRow`) is
 * asked of one line, before any block exists. It feeds `cutAtBands`, whose job
 * is to cut a row fused across a column gutter back into its columns — and a
 * fused two-column line is geometrically very close to a two-cell table row:
 * same runs, same gaps, same baselines, and the two fixtures that pin this
 * cannot be told apart by gap (28pt against 26pt) or by run count (two against
 * three). What separates them is the *width* of the runs: a table's cells are
 * labels and figures, a column's runs are spans of prose. So this reads both
 * the whole-line whitespace form (which a hand-built fixture and an OCR line
 * have) and, when there is none, the geometry restricted to cell-sized runs.
 * Getting it wrong in the generous direction stops columns being cut apart and
 * costs types 3, 7 and 12; getting it wrong in the strict direction flattens a
 * real table into one paragraph per column. The width test is the axis that
 * lets both stand.
 *
 * The two disagree on purpose, and `structure.test.ts` /
 * `readingOrder.test.ts` between them pin both halves.
 *
 * A third input, `TableContinuation`, exists for the one shape neither can
 * reach alone: a table cut by a page break can leave the next page with a
 * single row, and one row has nothing to recur against. The row is then judged
 * against the *table it came from* — same number of cells, same left edge —
 * rather than against itself. It is offered, never assumed: `tableForLines`
 * still answers `null` for every line that does not measure out that way.
 *
 * ### Why the old block-level test had to go
 *
 * It split `line.text` on `/\s{2,}|\t/`. `groupItemsIntoLines` collapses every
 * whitespace run to one space and trims *before* the structure pass ever sees
 * a line, so that pattern could not match a real PDF: table detection was
 * unreachable from any document, and only ever fired on lines a test built by
 * hand. Only geometry survives the collapse, so geometry is what the block
 * builder now reads.
