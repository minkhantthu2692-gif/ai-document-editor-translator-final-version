/**
 * Annotation notes: the text an annotation carries and the page never prints.
 *
 * A reviewed PDF keeps its marginalia in the annotation dictionary rather than
 * in the content stream. The words you can *see* — a heading, a paragraph, a
 * table cell — are show-text operators and reach the translator through the
 * normal line → block path. The words an annotation carries are not operators
 * at all:
 *
 *   - `/Contents`, the note itself: a sticky note's message, the reason a
 *     passage was highlighted, what the reviewer wrote on the callout;
 *   - a `/FreeText`'s body, which is drawn by its *appearance* stream, so a
 *     reader that only walks operators sees an empty box;
 *   - a stamp's legend.
 *
 * None of it is in the content stream, so no other pass in the pipeline —
 * grouping, reading order, footnotes, links, figures, form labels — can ever
 * translate it. This module is what does: it turns each note into an ordinary
 * `annotation` block, which means it enters the queue like any other text, is
 * editable in the workspace, and reaches every exporter with no exporter
 * knowing that review markup exists.
 *
 * Three subtypes are deliberately not read. `/Link` belongs to `links.ts`,
 * `/Widget` to `formFields.ts` — and `/Popup` is the window a viewer opens to
 * *display* its parent's `/Contents`, so reading it would print the same note
 * twice, once at a rectangle that is a viewer artefact. A note whose author
 * (`/T`) or date (`/M`) is recorded is deliberately *not* prefixed with either:
 * a name is not for translating. An annotation with nothing to say, or one the
 * author hid behind `/F 2`, yields no block. Nothing here ever removes or
 * rewrites printed text.

 * early — and an estimate that is a little generous costs a line of empty
 * space rather than an overlap, which is the trade `CHAR_EM` is set for.
 *
 * The face and the size come from the block it follows so it reads as part of
