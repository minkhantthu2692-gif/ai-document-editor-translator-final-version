/**
 * Form-field labels: the text a widget carries and the page never prints.
 *
 * A fillable PDF keeps its instructions in two different places. The words you
 * can *see* — `Full Name:`, `Country:` — are ordinary content-stream text and
 * reach the translator through the normal line → block path with nothing done
 * to them at all. The words you cannot see live on the widget itself:
 *
 *   - `/TU`, the alternate field name, is what a screen reader announces and
 *     what a tooltip shows;
 *   - `/Opt`, a choice field's option captions, are the things a reader picks
 *     from, and they are printed nowhere on the page.
 *
 * Neither string is in the content stream, so no other pass in the pipeline —
 * grouping, reading order, footnotes, links, figures — can ever translate them.
 * This module is what does: it turns both into ordinary `form-field` blocks,
 * which means they enter the queue like any other text, are editable in the
 * workspace, and reach every exporter with no exporter knowing about forms.
 *
 * A widget with nothing to say yields no block: a bare push button, a hidden
 * field, a text box that was never described, a radio kid whose label lives on
 * its group. Nothing here ever *removes* or rewrites printed text.
