/**
 * Reading order for a page's body lines.
 *
 * The flat line list of a PDF arrives in content-stream order, which is not
 * reading order: a two-column paper, a newspaper spread or a newsletter with a
 * full-width title all interleave badly once lines are naively sorted by y.
 *
 * Two facts drive this module:
 *
 *  1. **Columns must be ordered column-by-column, not row-by-row.** Sorting a
 *     multi-column page top-to-bottom alternates left and right on every line,
 *     which reads as nonsense and translates as nonsense.
 *  2. **A line that spans the gutter belongs to no column.** Titles, section
 *     rules, pull-quotes and full-width paragraphs cross the empty strip
 *     between columns. They are *zone boundaries*: everything above them is
 *     read as one zone, everything below as the next. Treating them as column
 *     members is what previously disabled column detection outright — one
 *     spanning title anywhere on the page and the whole page fell back to
 *     row-by-row order.
 *
 * So the algorithm is: find the gutter and the lines crossing it, cut the page
 * into zones at those spanning lines, and order each zone's column members
 * left-to-right (recursively, so three and four column layouts work).
 *
 * Every line in is returned exactly once — no line may be dropped, reordered
 * into oblivion, or duplicated, because the blocks built from this feed the
 * translator and the exporter. `orderBodyLines` is total: any ambiguity falls
 * back to plain top-to-bottom order rather than an answer that might lose
 * content.
